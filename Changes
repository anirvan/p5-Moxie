Revision history for Perl extension Moxie

0.05 2017-10-21
    [FEATURE CHANGES]
    - restored the `private` trait and ceased it being
      the default behavior as a result of a `has` call

    [DEPENDENCIES]
    - dropped the Devel::Hook dependency for the MOP::Util
      functions (which just use Devel::Hook themselves)
    - restored the Padwalker dependency
    - removed the Sub::Inject dependency (see above)
    - bump the MOP dependency

0.04 2017-09-27
    [FEATURE CHANGES]
    - moved the Moxie::Slot::Intitializer class to
      the MOP instead of here
    - lexical private lvalue slot accessors are now
      always generated, no need to specify them
      youself

    [DEPENDENCIES]
    - removed the B::CompilerPhase::Hook dependency
      and just use straight up Devel::Hook instead
    - removed the PadWalker dependency because we
      can now generate the slot accessor at BEGIN
      time and install them with Sub::Inject
    - added Sub::Inject dependency
    - bump the MOP dependency to support use of the
      MOP::Slot::Initializer class

    [FEATURE CHANGES]
    - the way the BUILDARGS:init_args trait works now
      is very different and not backwards compatible
        - added tests in t/100-annotations/010-init-args.t
        - docs added to the Moxie module
        - This change is NOT backwards compatible

    - `has` now (also) takes a set of option pairs and
       generates the correct initializer based on those
       options
        - docs added to the Moxie module
        - This change is backwards compatible

    [BUG FIXES]
    - classes can now be loaded at runtime
        - added tests for this

    [DEPENDENCIES]
    - version bump for BEGIN::Lift and Method::Traits
      to make sure classes can be loaded at runtime

      custom slot initializer usage
