Revision history for Perl extension Moxie

0.04
    [FEATURE CHANGES]
    - lexical private lvalue slot accessors are now
      always generated, no need to specify them
      youself

    [DEPENDENCIES]
    - removed the B::CompilerPhase::Hook dependency
      and just use straight up Devel::Hook instead
    - removed the PadWalker dependency because we
      can now generate the slot accessor at BEGIN
      time and install them with Sub::Inject
    - added Sub::Inject dependency
